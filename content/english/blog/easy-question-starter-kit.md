Do you ever wonder about life? Do you ask questions? It is good to ask questions! Asking questions helps us learn.

Here are some questions you might ask:

- Why am I here?
- What is my purpose?
- Is there more to life?
- Why is there suffering?
- What happens after death?
- Does God exist?
- How should I live?
- What has meaning?
- What is truth?

These questions are big questions. But do not be afraid to ask them! Wondering and asking is normal. It helps us grow.

When you have questions, talk to others. Talk to friends and family. Talk to teachers. Talk to faith leaders. Ask them your questions. It is ok if they do not know all the answers. The journey is what matters.

Keep asking. Keep learning. Keep growing. Do not stop wondering. Our questions can lead us to beautiful things.

So ask! Ask your questions. Go on your journey. See where your questions take you.
